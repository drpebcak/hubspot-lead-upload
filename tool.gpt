Perform the task one step at a time. Do not stop until all steps are completed.

1. Convert the excel file called {file} into a csv file called {file}.csv
2. Read the schema of the CSV file {file}.csv.
3. Based on the csv schema, remove any rows with a duplicate 'Email Address' and then output a new csv file using the following columns:
    - 'First Name' as 'firstname'
    - 'Last Name' as 'lastname'
    - 'Email Address' as 'email'
    - 'Company Name' as 'company'
    - 'Title' as 'jobtitle'
    - 'Street Address' (concatenate the values of 'Work Address 1' and 'Work Address 2' to make this field, with a space in between values) as 'address'
    - 'Work City' as 'city'
    - 'Work State' as 'state'
    - 'Work Country' as 'country'
4. Upload the final csv to hubspot. The list name should be '{listname}'
